## Introduction


#Research question

Is it feasible to produce an accurate machine learning algorithm that predicts the possibility of developing a heart disease in a wide array of patients? 

## Read the data

```{r}
heartdata <- read.csv("data/heart.csv")
#Age RestingBP Cholesterol MaxHR Oldpeak
heartdata$HeartDisease <- as.logical(heartdata$HeartDisease)
heartdata$FastingBS <- as.logical(heartdata$FastingBS)
```

```{r Cleaning}

# Changes Y/N to Boolean
heartdata$ExerciseAngina = heartdata$ExerciseAngina == "Y"
heartdata$FastingBS = as.logical(heartdata$FastingBS)
```




```{r}

summary(heartdata)
cor(heartdata$HeartDisease, heart$RestingBP)
```
