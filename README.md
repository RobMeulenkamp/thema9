## Navigation 

To inspect the logbook results, open the logbook.pdf or logbook.Rmd. All the data that is used in the logbook can be found in the data folder.
The data folder includes one sub folder ROC. In this folder, data files are stored for creating ROC curves which can be found in the logbook. 

Other files are Random Forest model, results from the experimenter in text files, and two csv files attr_inf and Rlibraries which is used for making the final report.

The final report is stored in the sub folder report including the pdf report file.
